Brunn is a laboratory information system for Bioclipse.

A plate type defines the size, number of columns and rows, of a plate. A plate
layout defines where on the plate the controls and the compounds are to be
placed. Based upon this plate layout a number of equal plates are made,
conforming to a so-called master plate that defines which drugs are placed in
which wells. Each one of these plates is seeded with one cell type and
incubated. After incubation, the plate is centrifuged and washed, and
fluorescein diacetate is added. Then the plate is washed again, and incubated
once more, before fluoroscence generated from fluorescein diacetate transformed
into a fluorescent by cells with intact cell membranes is measured with a
microplate fluorometer. The measurements are imported into Brunn and can be
viewed in the Plate editor.
