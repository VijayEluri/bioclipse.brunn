=Compound=

A compound in Brunn represents a substance of interest and can be placed in
wells in the Master Plate editor. 

==Creating a Compound==
To create a Compound right click on the folder named "Compounds" or any of the
subfolder and choose "Create Compound" and type a name in the dialog. You can
also type a molecular weight if you want to keep track of that for future
reference. There is a checkbox "keep creating more compounds" which will
relaunch the dialog when clicking Ok. This is handy when creating a big number
of compounds.

==Editing a Compound==
By double clicking a compound the compound is opened in an editor where name
and molecular weight can be edited.
