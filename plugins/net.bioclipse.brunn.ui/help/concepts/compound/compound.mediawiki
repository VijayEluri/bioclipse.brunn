=Compound=

A compound in Brunn represents a substance of interest, and can be placed in
wells in the Master Plate editor. 

==Creating a Compound==
To create a compound, right click on the folder named "Compounds" or any of its
subfolders, choose "Create Compound" and type a name in the dialog box. You can
also type a molecular weight in the cases when you want to keep track of that
for future reference. There is a checkbox "keep creating more compounds" which
will relaunch the dialog box when clicking Ok. This is handy when creating a
big number of compounds.

==Editing a Compound==
By double clicking a compound, you can open it in an editor where name and
molecular weight can be edited.
