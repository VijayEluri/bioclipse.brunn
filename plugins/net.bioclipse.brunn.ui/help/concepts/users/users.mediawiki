=Users=
Brunn features two user levels, "user" and "administrator". Besides the
capabilities of a user, an administrator can undelete resources marked as
deleted, and create new users.

Brunn keeps track of who created resources and when. This information can be
viewed in the outline view for resources that are selected in the Brunn
Explorer.

==Creating a User==
Administrators can create new users from the Brunn Explorer menu. To 
show the menu, click the triangle at the top of the Brunn Explorer view.
