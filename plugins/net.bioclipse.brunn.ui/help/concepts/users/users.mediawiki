=Users=
Brunn features two user levels, user and administrator. An administrator can do
everything that a user can plus undeleting resources marked as deleted and
creating new users.

Brunn keeps track of who created resources and when. This information can be
viewed in the outline view for resources that are selected in the Brunn
Explorer.

==Creating a User==
Administrators can create new users from the Brunn Explorer menu. To 
show the menu click the triangel at the top of the Brunn Explorer view.
