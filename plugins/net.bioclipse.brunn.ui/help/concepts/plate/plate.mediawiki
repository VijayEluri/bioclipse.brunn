=Plate=
A Brunn plate represents a real-life plate. It has substances and cells seeded
on it. When results are imported, they are added to plates.  

==Creating a Plate==
To create a plate, right click on the folder named "Plates" or any of its
subfolders, and choose "Create Plate". Type a name in the dialog box and choose
a master plate for the new plate. You will also have to type in a barcode for
the plate (which will be used when importing results for the plate), as well as
a cell line or patient cell to seed on the plate. 

==Importing result==
Result import is done by selecting the "Import results from File" action in the
Brunn Explorer view. The menu can be found by clicking the little triangle in
the upper right corner of the Brunn Explorer view. 

In the dialog box, browse for the data file, proceed using the "Next" button, and select which
plates to import. If there are no barcodes you might have to add barcodes by
double-clicking the barcode cell in the table and typing the barcode for that
plate. After you've clicked the "Finish" button, the data will be imported and
added to the plates in the system with the corresponding barcode. 

==Editing a Plate==
By double-clicking on a plate, you can open it in an editor with multiple tabs
for viewing the results for the plate.
