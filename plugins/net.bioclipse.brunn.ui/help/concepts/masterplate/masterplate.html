any of it's subfolders and choose "Create Master Plate", type a name in the
dialog box and choose a plate layout for the new master plate. You will also be

can connect well markers with substances by dragging and dropping and create
dilution series. </p><h3 id="Creating_a_Dilution_Serie">Creating a Dilution Serie</h3><p>Dilution series are created through connecting a substance to a marker by
dragging the substance from the Brunn Explorer and into the list of markers at
the bottom part of the editor. A dialog pops up and asks for information on how
to perform dilution over wells with that marker. It is possible to do the
dilution horisontally or vertically and wells with the marker in the other
direction will become replicates.</p></body></html>
