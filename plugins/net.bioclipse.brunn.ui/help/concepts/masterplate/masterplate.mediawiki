=Master Plate=
A master plate defines which compound marker correspond to which compound and
with what concentration. So a master plate corresponds to how substances are
placed on a batch of plates. 

==Creating a Master Plate==
To create a master plate, right click on the folder named "Master Plates" or
any of it's subfolders and choose "Create Master Plate", type a name in the
dialog box and choose a plate layout for the new master plate. You will also be
asked to type in the number of plates in the batch so the system can keep track
of how many plates are left in cryo store

==Editing a Master Plate==
By double-clicking on a master plate, you can open it in an editor where you
can connect well markers with substances by dragging and dropping and create
dilution series. 

===Creating a Dilution Serie===
Dilution series are created through connecting a substance to a marker by
dragging the substance from the Brunn Explorer and into the list of markers at
the bottom part of the editor. A dialog pops up and asks for information on how
to perform dilution over wells with that marker. It is possible to do the
dilution horisontally or vertically and wells with the marker in the other
direction will become replicates.
