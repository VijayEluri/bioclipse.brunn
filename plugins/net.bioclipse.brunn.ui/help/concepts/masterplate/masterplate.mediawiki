=Master Plate=
A master plate defines which compound marker corresponds to which compound and
with what concentration. So a master plate dictates how substances are to be
placed in a batch of plates. 

==Creating a Master Plate==
To create a master plate, right click on the folder named "Master Plates" or
any of its subfolders and choose "Create Master Plate". Type a name in the
dialog box and choose a plate layout for the new master plate. You will also be
asked to provide the number of plates in the batch, so that the system can keep
track of how many plates are left in cryo storage.

==Editing a Master Plate==
By double-clicking on a master plate, you can open it in an editor where you
can connect well markers to substances by dragging-and-dropping, and where you
can create dilution series.

===Creating a Dilution Serie===
Dilution series are created through connecting a substance to a marker by
dragging the substance from the Brunn Explorer and into the list of markers at
the bottom part of the editor. A dialog box pops up and asks for information on
how to perform dilution over wells with that marker. It is possible to do the
dilution horisontally or vertically, and wells with the marker in the other
direction will become replicates.
