=Plate Layout=
A plate layout defines which wells are to be used for which dilution series and
for controls and such. A plate layout also contains calculation formulae for
wells (such as survial index) and for plates (such as variation for all
blanks).

==Creating a Plate Layout==
To create a plate layout, right click on the folder named "Plate Layouts" or
any of it's subfolders and choose "Create Plate Layout", type a name in the
dialog box and choose a plate type for the new plate layout. 

==Editing a Plate Layout==
By double-clicking on a plate layout, you can open it in an editor where
you can assign well markers and define calculation functions. Each well is
represented as a cell in the matrix.

===Defining what wells are to be used for===
There are 5 different markers that can be placed on wells:

; M1, M2, M3... : Substance marker, one number for each compound
; C1, C2, C3... 
: Control markers, different controls can be used for different part of the plate
; B             : Blank
; P             : Positive Control
; S             : Solvent

To add a new marker, select one or more cells in the matrix, right click, and
choose the appropriate action. The actions available in the context menu will
change depending on your selection, so in order to remove a marker, right click
on it and choose the action for removing it.

As markers are added to the plate layout, so are a number of automatically
generated plate functions. Among others, functions for average of controls and
average of blanks. More about plate functions below.

===Writing Calculation Functions===
Calculation functions in Brunn come in two flavours - for plates and for
wells. A plate function is a general function for the plate. For example, it
can be the mean value or the variance for all blanks. A well function is a
value directly connected to a well; the prototypical example is survival index
(SI%). By default, each well has a well function raw() giving the raw value of
the well.

Below the matrix of wells in the plate layout editor are two tabs
named "Plate Functions" and "Well Functions". These are for creating the
calculation functions. To create a plate function, right click somewhere in that
tab and click "Add function". In the dialog box, type a name and the
expression. It is also possible to define an interval within which the plate
function is considered to have a good value.

There are a couple of convenience methods, and a few terms that are useful 
when writing calculation functions:

;sum    : Sum of the given values 
;avg    : The average of the given values 
;stddev : The standard deviation of the given values

It is also possible to give intervals of wells, such as method(well1:well2) so
to write a function that calculates the average over the raw values for wells
A1, A2, B1, B2 one could write avg(A1, A2, B1, B2) or avg(A1:B2).

Creating well functions is done in a similar way to plate functions. Make sure
that the "Well Functions" tab is selected, select a number of wells, right
click in the bottom half of the editor and choose "Add function". In the dialog
box that pops up, write a name (for example si%) and type an expression. If
you are doing multiple wells at once and you want to use each well's raw value
in the calculation, you can reach it by using the variable 'well', which will
be converted into the variable holding the raw value for each well.  As an
example, a typical SI% function using control group C1 could look like this:

100 * ( well - AVG_AllBlanks() ) / ( AVG_C1() - AVG_AllBlanks() ) 

Notice the references to the automatically generated methods AVG_AllBlanks()
and AVG_C1().
